        <h1>Resources</h1>
        <h3>Here are some resources that I personally use in online investigations regarding social media:</h3>
        <ul align=left>
  <li>usersearch.org</li> <p align=left> Use this to verify the accounts you found manually in social media. Only use as last resort if you cannot find any accounts of theirs at all.</p>
            <br>
  <li>aware-online.com</li> <p align=left> Same with this as well. Use this to verify the accounts you found manually in social media. Only use as last resort if you cannot find any accounts of theirs at all.</p>
            <br>
  <li>Google Dorking</li> <p align=left> I am very sure that you can find websites and YouTube videos helping you out. You can not only find social media posts but almost everything under the sun about them if you use the right keywords. One of the most useful features ever.  </p>
            <br>
  <li>Truecaller</li> <p align=left> I don't recommend doing this as login requires phone verification. It is very useful to reverse check numbers you found of the suspect/their acquaintances.</p>
            <br>
  <li>Finding through informants</li> <p align=left> This is the foolproof method that I used twice. You can ask me to retrieve information from one. They mostly have social media accounts so it will be easy if you ask an informant who knows the suspect and their account(s)  </p>
            <br>
  <li> Login yourself and find out</li> <p align=left> My most favorite. I strongly advise to use a temporary account on a secure VPN and delete the account completely after searching. If you are, however going on Snapchat, be extra careful (while however it is the easiest method to find someone if you have their number saved) as our very own Principal of 9th and above has an active account on there.   </p>
