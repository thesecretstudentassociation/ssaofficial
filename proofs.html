        <h2>1: THE SCENE CASE:</h2>
        <li> STATUS: Currently semi- active.</li>
        Details: 
        <ul> <li> One of the most important cases the Agency has took upon. Active since May 2024, it aims to neutralize a certain group of students nicknamed "The Scene Gang" among Agency members, who poses a great threat to sensitive students. </li> 
        <li> Initially, what was thought to be an easy task of solving 2 rumours and infiltrating them completely and obtain proof to submit to teachers is taking more than one full year (at the time of updation, 29th August 2025) and a seriously huge amount of associates and members to neutralize them. Personal drama among members and on-field agents, plus the ignorance of the teachers in Candidate list was enough to prove this was about to be a Himalayan task.  </li>
<li> Along with this case, several other cases were also taken upon during the period of August 2024- September 2024, and we came upon a shocking discovery that this was a case intertwined with many, many others we took upon in our free time during when we didn't have enough evidence to proceed with this. Hell, even I (Ingale) would call it the "Source of all", because solving this ONE case would bring about 3-4 other cases (listed below) to a complete halt. </li>
