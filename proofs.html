        <h2>1: THE SCENE CASE:</h2>
        <li> STATUS: Currently semi- active.</li>
      <p> Details: </p>
       <p>One of the most important cases the Agency has took upon. Active since <strong>May 2024</strong>, it aims to neutralize a certain group of students nicknamed <strong> "The Scene Gang" </strong> among Agency members, who poses a great threat to sensitive students. </p> 
      <p>  Initially, what was thought to be an easy task of solving 2 rumours and infiltrating them completely and obtain proof to submit to teachers is taking more than one full year (at the time of updation, 29th August 2025) and a seriously huge amount of associates and members to neutralize them. Personal drama among members and on-field agents, plus the ignorance of the teachers in <strong> Candidate list </strong> was enough to prove this was about to be a Himalayan task.  </p>
<p>Along with this case, several other cases were also taken upon during the period of <strong> August 2024 - September 2024 </strong>, and we came upon a shocking discovery that this was a case intertwined with <strong> many, many others </strong> we took upon in our free time during when we didn't have enough evidence to proceed with this. Hell, even I (Ingale) would call it the <strong>"Source of all" </strong>, because solving this <strong>ONE</strong> case would bring about 3-4 other cases (listed below) to a complete halt. </p>
       <li> NOTE FOR MEMBERS: <p> In order to maintain secrecy, as this is an extremely classified case, I can't mention every single detail here. Contact Ingale for more information. And speaking of which, it would be a huge help if you are able to find people who have any strong evidence <strong> (photos or screenshots of chats within the group or witnesses of any serious things done by them)</strong> against them. We, the Agency will be <strong> more than glad </strong> to keep them as a valuable associate until the period for which we can provide them utmost security. </p> </li>
